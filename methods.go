/*Since there is no class-object architecture and the closest thing to class we have is structure.
Function with struct receiver is a way to achieve methods in Go.*/

//What is a method
//As you know that struct field can also be a function, the concept of method will be very easy for you to understand. A method is nothing but a function, but it belongs to a certain type. A method is defined with different syntax than normal function. It required an additional parameter known as a receiver which is a type to which the method belongs. A method can access properties of the receiver it belongs to.

	FirstName, LastName string
}

type Employee2 struct {
	name   string
	salary int
}

func (e Employee) fullName() string {
	return e.FirstName + " " + e.LastName
}

//Same method name
//One major difference between function and method is many methods can have the same name while no two functions with the same name can be defined in a package.

	// A method can accept both pointer and value
	//When a function has a value argument, it will only accept the value of the parameter. If you passed a pointer to the function which expects a value, it will not work. This is also true when function accepts pointer, you simply can not pass a value to it.
	//When it comes to a method, thatâ€™s not the case. We can define a method with value or pointer receive and call it on pointer or value.
